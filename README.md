zfsweb -- Primitive ZFS snapshot browser
========================================

zfsweb is a basic web interface to a ZFS snapshot hierarchy.  Written
in Perl, using only a handful of lightweight external modules, and
generating an interface using Twitter Bootstrap, it's fast, responsive
and friendly.
